# About This Website

## Why did I create this website?

My hope is that this can be a space where I can share things that are on my mind and that might, in some way, be valuable to others.

## Who am I?

To be honest, that is a question that I also find myself asking and trying to answer. To provide a short biography, I was born in 2001 and have been living ever since.

If you have further questions or suggestions feel free to drop them at &thinsp;<code>iylc.contact@gmail.com</code>&thinsp;. I may very well update this page to answer common questions and may very well write about topics other have interest in and may very well do neither. But I will at the very least read what you send.
