<h1>
	About This Website
</h1>
<p>
	<b>What is this website for?</b> My hope is that this can be a space where I can share things that are on my mind and that might, in some way, be valuable to others.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Who am I?</b> To be honest, that is a question that I myself am also asking and trying to answer. If you want a short biography, I was born in 2001 and have been living ever since.

	If you have questions or suggestions feel free to drop them at &thinsp;<code>iylc.contact@gmail.com</code>&thinsp;. I very well may update this page to answer common questions and very well may write about topics other have interest in.
